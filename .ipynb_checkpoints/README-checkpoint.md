# Project-1-College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study
 Repository for the first project of Data Science Programming

##### This study is intended to identify strengths and weaknesses in the CCM Information Technologies Department's recruitment record. Each fall, students in entry level computing classes complete a survey on their educational aspirations, as well as what drove them to enroll in a computing class. The information gathered will be analyzed to identify what strategies/areas are most effective at drawing in students. Ultimately, the goal of the study is to find the best strategies for increasing enrollment within the IT department.
